# Wordpress - Redirect after users complete profile form

## What is this?

If you are working with Wordpress and have developed a user profile form on the front end of a website this hook will help you to redirect users to a specific URL after they complete (100% completed) their profile.

## Why use this?
My idea would be to show a page with some content to let users know that their accounts are being reviewed after completing a profile form. So this kind of users will get even a new role called "members-in-approval" and once an admin reviews their profile and approve them, they would get the role "active member".
